## About

In a conversation with **John Carmack** (legendary game developer and AI researcher), **Ilya Sutskever** shared a curated reading list of approximately 30 foundational papers, blog posts, and resources that form the backbone of modern deep learning and artificial intelligence.

This list is exceptional because it:

- **Focuses on fundamentals** that have stood the test of time
- **Covers the full spectrum** from basic neural networks to cutting-edge architectures
- **Includes theory and practice** - mathematical foundations alongside practical implementations
- **Represents real depth** - these aren't just popular papers, they're the ones that truly matter

This repository organizes Sutskever's recommendations into a structured learning path, provides context for each resource, and maintains an active community of learners working through the material together.

### Why This List Matters

Unlike most AI reading lists that grow indefinitely, Sutskever's list is deliberately constrained. The "90% of what matters" philosophy means these papers provide maximum insight with minimal redundancy. Master these, and you'll have a foundation that enables you to:

- Understand and implement modern architectures from scratch
- Read cutting-edge research papers with confidence
- Make informed architectural decisions in your own work
- Grasp the theoretical underpinnings of why things work

## Getting Started

### For Self-Learners

**Start with the fundamentals:** If you're new to deep learning, begin with CS231n and work through the Beginner Path sequentially. Don't skip ahead—each paper builds on previous concepts.

**Implement as you learn:** The best way to understand these papers is to implement them. Start with The Annotated Transformer as a template for how to read a paper while coding.

**Take notes:** Maintain a learning journal where you summarize each paper in your own words. This active processing dramatically improves retention.

**Join the community:** Use GitHub Discussions to ask questions, share insights, and find study partners.

### For Study Groups

**Structure:** Meet weekly, with each person responsible for presenting one paper. Budget 2-3 hours per paper for reading and preparation.

**Discussion format:**

- 10 min: Context and motivation
- 20 min: Main technical content
- 15 min: Implementation details
- 15 min: Discussion and connections to other papers

**Shared implementation:** As a group, implement 3-5 of the most important papers from scratch. This shared codebase becomes a learning resource for everyone.

### For Researchers

**Use as a foundation:** If you're entering a new research area, this list provides the essential background. Use the Theory section to ground your intuitions.

**Connect to your work:** As you read each paper, explicitly note connections to your research interests. This builds a mental map of the field.

## Implementation Resources

### Code Repositories

Several papers have excellent reference implementations:

- **The Annotated Transformer**: Complete working implementation in PyTorch
- **CS231n Assignments**: Hands-on coding exercises for CNNs, RNNs, and transformers
- **AlexNet**: Available in all major frameworks
- **ResNet**: Official implementation and countless tutorials

### Recommended Tools

- **PyTorch**: Best for research and learning (dynamic computation graphs)
- **JAX**: Excellent for understanding autograd and transformations
- **NumPy**: Implement from scratch for deepest understanding

### Learning Projects

After mastering the core papers, build these projects to solidify understanding:

1. **Character-level language model** (RNNs + LSTMs)
2. **Image classifier from scratch** (CNNs + ResNets)
3. **Machine translation system** (Attention + Transformers)
4. **Neural Turing Machine** (External memory)

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to read every paper cover-to-cover?**
A: No. Read for understanding, not completion. Some papers you'll skim, others you'll implement. Let your learning goals guide you.

**Q: What math background do I need?**
A: Calculus, linear algebra, probability. CS231n has good review materials if you're rusty.

**Q: How long does it take to complete?**
A: 6-12 months working steadily. The goal isn't speed—it's deep understanding.

**Q: Can I skip the theory papers?**
A: You can, but you shouldn't. They provide crucial intuitions for why techniques work.

**Q: Are there video lectures?**
A: CS231n has excellent videos. For most papers, you'll need to read the actual paper.
